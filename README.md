In our *Bayesian Beginners Book Club* we are currently reading [Statistical Rethinking by McElreath](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429029608). My goal is to do all the exercises from the 2nd Edition of the book in R. To hold myself accountable, I have created this repository. Here, I will upload my solutions and document my progress.

*Please note: These are my solutions, meaning they're not necessarily correct*.

Current status:

- [x] Exercises Ch2
- [ ] Exercises Ch3 (HARD exercises missing)
- [ ] Exercises Ch4 (4E3, 4M8, 4H4, 4H6, 4H7, 4H8 missing)
- [ ] Exercises Ch5 (5M5 missing, HARD exercises missing? Are these from version 1 of the book?)
- [ ] Exercises Ch6
- [ ] Exercises Ch7 (medium and hard missing)
